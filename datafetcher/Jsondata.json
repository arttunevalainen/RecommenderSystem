Whereas Crops are relatively flimsy and easy to destroy, Animals are permanent. Each Animal will provide many points to your farming operation, assuming you're willing to pay!<br/><br/>The goal for this expansion is to create a balance between tactical Crop management and strategic Animals. It also broadens the strategic choices of the game and adds depth without too much complexity. Players will need to make a choice with their Action cards to lean into animals, crops, or both, to squeak out ahead. Along with the animals will come new Action cards, special animal abilities, and a little bidding to top it off.<br/><br/>In addition to animals, Livestocked and Loaded will introduce Weather Events. These will shake things up so that no game is the same.<br/><br/>The best part is that you won't need to relearn the game. Livestocked and Loaded is built upon the simple framework of the original Farmageddon game. On each turn you're going to Draw Crop cards, Farm and Play Action Cards, then Draw Action cards.<br/><br/>\",\"thumbnail\":\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/C3D2vCozKNBOKq9lGG1s3Nubo9o=/fit-in/200x150/pic2000020.png\",\"image\":\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/OU7GxdBsQevgSOBYDX9ynaqNJLs=/0x0/pic2000020.png\",\"id\":\"121841\",\"publishers\":[\"5th Street Games\"],\"categories\":[\"Card Game\",\"Expansion for Base-game\",\"Farming\",\"Humor\"],\"mechanics\":[\"Area Control / Area Influence\",\"Card Drafting\",\"Hand Management\"],\"designers\":[\"Grant Rodiek\"],\"artists\":[\"Brett Bean\",\"Erin Fusco\"],\"family\":[\"Crowdfunding: Kickstarter\"],\"expansions\":[\"Farmageddon\"]}","{\"yearpublished\":1990,\"minplayers\":1,\"maxplayers\":48,\"playingtime\":10,\"minplaytime\":10,\"maxplaytime\":10,\"age\":12,\"name\":\"Three Bears Family Fun\",\"description\":\"A simple roll and move affair where colourful plastic bears race to the roof of their house, this game is included in the Three Bears Family Fun activity set.

It saw two former &lsquo;Great&rsquo; powers decline; for Sweden it was a cataclysmic experience as they were reduced to a small or medium power. While Poland-Lithuania started on the path that would lead to extinction later in the century. It saw two medium sized powers, Denmark and Saxony, fail in their bid to gain, or regain, &lsquo;Great&rsquo; powers status. It saw two powers rise; for Brandenburg-Prussia it was an important stepping stone to Great power status later in the century. While for Russia went from being &lsquo;an obscure barbarous nation&rsquo; to a Great power thanks to its victories<br/><br/>Polemos: Great Northern War is aimed at gaming large scale actions from this time. It is quite possible to stage, play and complete actions in an evening and even the largest action should be relatively easy to play. The emphasis is on the Great Northern War but other actions from this period can also be fought. The wars against the Ottoman Empire, the Polish Civil War and other actions in the period 1695 to 1725 may also be fought. You can be Peter the Great of Russia and face the cream of what was probably the best army in the world of this period &ndash; Charles XII Swedish army. Perhaps instead you could as Peter battle the Ottomans on the river Prut.<br/><br/>The Great Northern War has perhaps not been gamed as much as would be expected for such an important conflict with many interesting battles and armies. To a large extent this is because of the lack of information about the war and its battles. Polemos: GNW will introduce information and army lists that will rectify this. You too will be able to command the combined Saxon, Polish and Russian army at the battle of Kalisz (1706) or re-fight the Polish civil war battle of Koniecpol (1708).<br/><br/>\",\"thumbnail\":\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/cEIDVnFlcmGq4FCBx3e-g9K9QBA=/fit-in/200x150/pic86495.jpg\",\"image\":\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/5Z2kUwzrrQh5as3OdFPVmHF4jMY=/0x0/pic86495.jpg\",\"id\":\"18918\",\"publishers\":[\"Baccus 6mm Ltd.\"],\"categories\":[\"Age of Reason\",\"Miniatures\",\"Wargame\"],\"mechanics\":[\"Baccus 6mm Ltd.\"],\"designers\":[\"Nick Dorrell\"],\"family\":[\"Country: Sweden\",\"Polemos\"]}","{\"yearpublished\":2018,\"minplayers\":2,\"maxplayers\":4,\"playingtime\":150,\"minplaytime\":120,\"maxplaytime\":150,\"age\":12,\"name\":\"Merca-Tiny\",\"description\":\"A new market has opened in the city square. Great business opportunity awaits the most enterprising merchants.<br/><br/>Who will be the richest of the square (the winner), in the end?<br/><br/>As a trader, each player on their turn can open new stalls (place one or more stall-tiles) following the strict municipal rules or bring new customers to the market (move a customer). In the city, customers have a somewhat extravagant and habitual behavior: they always walk straight ahead until they meet stalls, then they always turn around counterclockwise; they buy clothes and shoes in any order, but only vegetables or fish after buying vegetables, and only other fish, after they buying fish. Obviously customers buy only products that are on their shopping list.<br/> Try to open your stalls in strategic position and keep an eye on price trends: the best selling goods will be more expensive in the next rounds. But stalls of a goods type can inflate that goods.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, beware of thieves, workers, policeman and many other characters that could benefit (or damage) your (or opponents) business: You have action disks that can be spent to pick-up and/or use special actions of such characters.<br/><br/>Be careful to plan your actions in time, as the market is divided into phases, marked by the opening of increasingly modern stalls: during the game the old stalls will be scrapped. When all the stalls are exhausted or when at least one of the goods has reached the maximum price, the market will be closed and the game will be over.<br/><br/>\",\"thumbnail\":\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/YLMLPqJAg0-Q9JjJocoWGSibbtM=/fit-in/200x150/pic4034868.png\",\"image\":\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/dK8zwy_xQP1Nc3diPeqOIvczzec=/0x0/pic4034868.png\",\"id\":\"246546\",\"publishers\":[\"(Web published)\"],\"categories\":[\"Economic\",\"Print & Play\"],\"mechanics\":[\"(Web published)\"],\"designers\":[\"Michele Fabbri\"]}","{\"yearpublished\":1977,\"minplayers\":2,\"maxplayers\":4,\"playingtime\":30,\"minplaytime\":30,\"maxplaytime\":30,\"age\":5,\"name\":\"Where's My Bone?\",\"description\":\"From the box:<br/>A game for 2-4 players, aged 5 years and over.<br/>These little dogs have hidden their bones and don't know where they are.

Players have five card slots in front of them, from which they play cards into the center of the table onto piles which comprise dragons made up of first a tail, then the numbers 1-10, and then a head.  When players have played a card from one of their slots, they then quickly replace it with one from their deck.  Players may play on any dragon stack in the center, which leads to a great deal of frenzy as players try to monitor their own play stacks, keep an eye on the multiple dragon piles that are constantly growing, and try to avoid allowing other players to gain an advantage in building.<br/><br/>Optional rules introduce complexity in scoring, the color sequencing of dragons, battles between players for simultaneous card play, and two-headed or two-tailed dragons.

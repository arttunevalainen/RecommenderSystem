You will have to be clever to estimate the number of outlaws needed to attack &ndash; and watch out for the Sheriff and your opponents!<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Each round, players bid on the right to perform the next bank robbery by placing a number of outlaws in the center of the playing area; each player starts with eight outlaws. Alternatively a player can skip the round or postpone an attack until after other players bid, but doing so will cause one or more of his outlaws to become wounded. When a player bids outlaws, the sheriff token moves a number of city tiles equal to the number of outlaws bid (in most cases). If a sheriff lands on a player's Chief of the Outlaws token &ndash; as these tokens are located on city tiles and not used for bidding &ndash; one of that player's outlaws is wounded.<br/><br/>The winner of the bid attacks a city, most likely netting him gold and possibly giving him new outlaws (as they are freed from that city's prison), but which city is attacked is determined by the difference between the winning bid and the lowest bid. Thus, bids from the other players will influence the winner's gains &ndash; and if the winner lands on the city tile where the sheriff is located, he gets nothing. The player with the second highest bid attacks the stagecoach and gains one silver.<br/><br/>If a player claims something from a city tile, it's flipped over and now has a different power for the remainder of the game, allowing a player who lands on the tile to steal gold or silver cubes from an opponent or wounding one of that player's outlaws. After each round, players collect the outlaws they used to bid and &quot;wound&quot; the healthy outlaws by flipping them over to their wounded side. A wounded outlaw who is wounded again is removed from the game. (Prisoners come into the game wounded, so they can be used only once.)<br/><br/>The game ends when no player has any outlaws remaining or all players refuse to bid in a given round.

You've got seven time jumps to complete as many missions as possible, but watch out for paradoxes; if two or more Sarahs meet in the same time zone, everything about them will change in an instant and all your plans could go up in smoke.<br/><br/>In Sarah's Singularity, players select an assortment of time periods from prehistoric Pangea to ComicCon 2012 and establish a set of missions for each period. Stranded companions from far-ranging times are scattered among the chosen periods and each player gets a &quot;Sarah Card&quot; with special powers. Finally, players choose two secret objective cards for hidden endgame scoring and a Chronologist is selected from the gathered players.<br/><br/>Each round, Future Sarah visits a time period to strand another companion and the players simultaneously and secretly select a time period to jump to where they hope to solve a mission by matching icons on the mission card with icons on the stranded companion cards and the icons on their own hand of helpful companions. Typically, when the selected periods are revealed, they're resolved in chronological order. However, if two or more Sarahs (including the Future Sarah) land in the same time period, they paradox! Those player immediately turn in their Sarah Cards and get a new one at random, losing the special powers they may have planned to use to help solve the mission. The Chronologist then decides the order in which the paradoxing players gets to take their turns.

The game has 3 Levels, each getting progressively more difficult.<br/>Runners who successfully reach a Level&rsquo;s End Zone are awarded points (credits), depending on the height of track and the Level. A runner who completes one Level can then tackle the next one (hopefully with their other team mates if they also finished it).<br/>You control a team of 3 Runners.

Will your comic involve Dinosaurs, Secret Hideouts and Car Chases? Werewolves, Obnoxious Coworkers and The Desire to Be Famous? Or Pirates, Blobs and The Last Human on Earth? When time is up, follow these simple rules to score the game:<br/><br/><br/>    Rule 1: You get 1 Fame point for each Theme you express in your comic in a way the other players can recognize by drawing it or writing it in a word balloon. <br/>    Rule 2: You get 2 Fame for drawing something in every Panel, no matter how simple. <br/>    Rule 3: You get 2 more Fame for keeping it succinct by using three or fewer Word Balloons on the page. It's that easy.<br/><br/><br/>Rounds two through four introduce an element of strategy: Trend Cards. Each Trend Card gives you new ways to earn Fame points for that round. Unlike Themes, which are personal, Trend Cards represent the market and affect every player in the game. Your fickle readers may want you to inject Superheroes, Funny Animals, Medical drama, Disaster stories, Mystery,  Romance, or any one of 52 Trends into your story. It's every artist's dilemma: stick to your original story, or sell out for Fame?<br/><br/>Each round brings more Panels to draw and Trends to chase. Plus, each round has more Fame in play than the round before, so the outcome is up in the air until the very end.<br/><br/>When the final round ends, the winner is the one with the most Fame Tokens, but every player ends the game with their own comic.<br/><br/>With literally hundreds of thousands of possible combinations of story prompts, you'll never run out of ideas.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/yChHNkXY2wMf2Mutcz1LLAWcCPM=/fit-in/200x150/pic4227362.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/jTpd4rVzBEJyEccAjt0-2YcZh1Y=/0x0/pic4227362.jpg","id":"242409","publishers":["Japanime Games"],"categories":["Comic Book / Strip","Real-time"],"mechanics":["Paper-and-Pencil","Storytelling"],"designers":["Jason Thompson"],"artists":["Konstantin Pogorelov"],"family":["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]},{"yearpublished":1996,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":22,"playingtime":20,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":20,"age":8,"name":"Quickit","description":"From the paradise islands of Trinidad and Tobago, to the Cricket lovers of the world, QUICKIT -a parody with dice by Parodice Games.<br/><br/>Experience the 'glorious uncertainties' of your favorite sport, with an exhilarating board game the whole family will enjoy.<br/><br/>Excellent ground, weather and light conditions all year round.

Rather quickly, REVENGE! evolved into a completely original game that featured an intriguing blend of complex board game and basic elements of role-playing.  The game generally follows a roll-and-move paradigm around a rectangular board (looking something like a doubled Monopoly board.  Various board locations may cause special circumstances, including &quot;teleporting&quot; to off-board locales where, generally, various types of player-vs-player activities are allowed.<br/><br/>The game primarily was designed by Jack Harness and other members of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Association in the early 1970s; it had assumed a stable, final form by about 1972.  Games were said to last from hours to days.  It was routinely played (and continuously modified) by society members until about the advent of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Many game proponents created implementations of the game, all with hand-drawn art from Jack Harness, some with minor rules variations.<br/><br/>In 2016, Lee Gold and Barry Gold converted their personal extant copy into electronic format.  This involved a general revision for clarity and format of the not-inconsiderable rule book, as well as a production of a color electronic playing board.  This version was published for free download, intended for print-and-play use.  In addition to the revised and cleaned-up game, a scan of the original products also was made available.<br/><br/>The game is intriguing as a very early example of a basic type of role-playing game prior to the commercial advent of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Iovl2Q8KoBixNGGI9ckPIUAgKa0=/fit-in/200x150/pic3208832.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/h66-xUXwIFuUpq9YehA9aILOn6k=/0x0/pic3208832.png","id":"210209","publishers":["(Self-Published)","(Web published)"],"categories":["Dice","Fantasy","Print & Play","Science Fiction"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Player Elimination","Role Playing","Roll / Spin and Move","Variable Player Powers"],"designers":["Phil Castora","Sandy Cohen","Lee Gold","Barry Gold","Jack Harness","Ted Johnstone"],"artists":["Jack Harness"]},{"yearpublished":2012,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"playingtime":20,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":20,"age":8,"name":"Irezumi","description":"Irezumi is a game in which players play the role of the Yakuza's leaders identified with unique different tattoos (secret card).

The initial invasion began in the Pacific Ocean and its bordering coastlines, which is also portrayed on the game board. There are 16 major coastal city zones which were involved in the war of the Pacific Campaign, and are beautifully illustrated by the artist, Becca T-R.<br/><br/>The game contains 20 mecha characters in eight variant designs, as well as 20 kaiju characters of eight different species, including the Warlord, who is the Supreme Commander of the Sazarran invasion force. Fighting along with and supporting the mecha are Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine and Transport units. The Sazzarran have their own version of Army, Air, Sea, Reaper and Drone units.<br/><br/>There are six phases during each game turn. In the World Event Phasee, the UNRF player rolls to gain or lose resources such as military units or mecha through Resource Cards. The Sazzarran player rolls to determine how many portals appear at the beginning of each game turn; from one to three portals. In the Resource Phase, the players receive their military forces, mecha, kaiju and bases to deploy on the game board. In the Movement Phase, the Sazzarran player deploys first, and the UNRF player moves to counter attack against the Sazzarran forces.<br/><br/>In the Battle Phase, the players will battle for control of city, land, and coastal zones and destroy the most forces to gain the most victory points. In the Re-Deployment Phase, the players are given opportunity to move their units to friendly zones to reinforce weaker zones and move mecha and kaiju back to a friendly base to heal. In the Control Phase, the players calculate the Victory Points (VPs) each has received. The first to reach or exceed 120 VPs, wins the game.<br/><br/>There are alternate victory conditions to play. There are bio-bombs and nukes, as well as the opportunity to destroy the city zones through collateral damage during battle and/or by the use of the nuclear devices.<br/><br/>In this game you could deploy a lot of mecha and kaiju on each side as you use them as frontline assault units to support the regular military units. There is strategy and some luck with dice rolling during battle. So, prepare for battle in an effort to prevent a Kaiju Conquest.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/5N0cCQNY0JDFPFHZmDVvjEbtONU=/fit-in/200x150/pic2348377.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/lILN7easAjAAMkKzriFyyf6oIJk=/0x0/pic2348377.jpg","id":"170740","publishers":["(Self-Published)"],"categories":["Science Fiction","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Area Control / Area Influence","Area Movement","Dice Rolling"],"designers":["Warren Loewen"],"family":["Admin: Unreleased Games","Crowdfunding: Kickstarter","Kaiju"]},{"yearpublished":1983,"minplayers":4,"maxplayers":4,"playingtime":90,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":90,"age":11,"name":"Ein, Zwei, Drei","description":"A partnership card game, played with traditional playing cards.<br/>Each player is dealt 13 cards but only 12 tricks are played for.

Cards can be humans, zombies, infected humans, cops or bombs. On each turn a player has to draw a card and then play a card.<br/><br/>Human cards (with values 1 to 5) are played in front of them and represent the people they have saved.<br/><br/>Zombies are played so that other player has to discard some of their human cards (which ones and how many depend on the zombie played).<br/><br/>Infected humans are very bad cards to have in your hand because they eat two human cards from the same player.<br/><br/>Cops can act as heroes and sacrifice themselves to save humans when attacked by zombies.<br/><br/>Finally bomb cards have 2 uses. They can be used to stop a zombie attack, or they can be used in any turn to gain an additional card to your hand.

Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?<br/><br/>BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.<br/><br/>Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.<br/><br/>If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who'll get his shot off first?

On your turn you must do the following actions:<br/><br/>1) PLAY A TILE from your Activation Area.<br/><br/>The first tile played by each player WILL NOT ACTIVATE ITS ABILITY. So it is very important you choose well which of your archetypes wont be used in the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>A tile played must always be adjacent to another tile (even diagonally) So you cannot place a tile anywhere in the imaginary grid.<br/><br/>A tile played always enters the game on the side it was in the Activation Area. So if the tile played was ACTIVE it stays with the side of the banner up and if the tile was INACTIVE it stays with the side that has a token drawn.<br/><br/>Consider INACTIVE tiles as protected from abilities when they are in PLAY since abilities cannot target INACTIVE tiles. It&acute;s a very good strategy to keep this in mind because an opponent won&acute;t be able to affect one of your INACTIVE tiles.<br/><br/>2) ACTIVE its ability (if possible)<br/><br/>Tiles that have been affected by an ability are turned to the INACTIVE SIDE (the one with the token on it). Same happens with the King and Queen.<br/><br/>Abilities cannot affect tiles that are in play with the INACTIVE SIDE up. This means that once a tile has been turned to the INACTIVE SIDE it&acute;s safe on the board. It can be moved as usual by its owner but will not altered by an opponent.<br/><br/><br/>3) MOVE ONE OF YOUR TILES IN PLAY ONE SPACE (diagonally or perpendicularly)<br/><br/>Notice that the joker has a special ability that allows you to move ONE MORE TIME after you placed it. This is a very strategical ability that can make big difference when you are trying to reposition a high influence tile on your turn or when you want to remove an opponent tile as well. Under no circumstance a tile can end up or move over another tile in the table.<br/><br/>When you move a tile it must always end adjacent to another tile. So you cannot move it on empty space unless it ended there due to the movement of the other tiles.<br/><br/><br/>END GAME &amp; WINNING CONDITIONS<br/><br/>The game will end when one of this two conditions happen:<br/><br/>1) One player starts his/her turn with his target consort surrounded by his own tiles  (perpendicularly).<br/><br/>The victory is total. The more you play the less this condition is going to happen.<br/><br/>2) The players have played all of their tiles.<br/><br/>Once the players have played all of their tiles comes the scoring. For this step only the tiles that surround PERSPERNDICULARLY (up, down and sides) each royal consort will count. Add all the influence numbers in the tiles, PLUS all the tokens if there are INACTIVE tiles among them (each one is worth 1 point) MINUS the total influence on the tiles your opponent has surrounding your royal consort. Compare this numbers... the player with the most influence WINS the game. In case of a tie... you are both too smart to outwit each other :)<br/><br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>20 double sided tiles<br/>1 king<br/>1 queen<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/0QDQpTle9Zy0d-Qak5P7O5TF9jA=/fit-in/200x150/pic1973707.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/M0Q-m3TTl0QXrZ4IUOH8Zng5ZOw=/0x0/pic1973707.png","id":"157137","publishers":["(Web published)"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Deduction","Fantasy","Print & Play"],"mechanics":["Grid Movement","Tile Placement"],"designers":["Guillermo H.

For example, one can score if one knows that the local museum houses the original death mask of William Shakespeare, that the 1990 world-championship in solar racing was won by students of the city's university, that &quot;Kn&auml;&auml;rze&quot; is local slang for the end piece of a bread, or the country were the 2009 world championship in amateur boxing had been won by a local boxer.<br/><br/>The game is of standard quality for a German boardgame with 6 classical wooden meeples and a full-color thick cardboard board.

These pieces are placed on the board to create a particular board configuration before the main game starts: this is called the setup phase.<br/>A given board configuration may be played repeatedly, with players taking turns to play as black and as white. Since each board configuration will have its own nuances, repeated play enables players to experiment with strategies best suited to each setup.<br/>Alternatively, Mapello can be played in free-play mode. In free-play mode, players take it in turns to setup the board. In order to encourage balance in the setup, the player not setting up the board has the option to play as black or as white (hence to move first or second).<br/><br/>The extra pieces are as follows:<br/>-    Walls: They act like the walls of the board border, but placed inside the board. They are immovable obstacles that cannot be played on.<br/>-    Bonuses: They reward the player with extra points when captured.<br/>-    Jokers (addition by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s): They are placed on the border and act as pieces of the colour of the player in turn.<br/><br/>By combining these pieces, players can create millions of different boards.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>-    Game board of 10x10 squares. The inner 8x8 board is used for playing, while the border is only used to place the jokers during the setup phase. <br/>-    64 Reversi discs (black/white).<br/>-    8 walls (gray squares).<br/>-    8 bonuses (blue discs).<br/>-    8 jokers (red squares).<br/><br/>SETUP PHASE<br/><br/>Optionally, the players may agree some constraints on the number of each type of piece to be placed during the setup phase. Then, subject to these constraints the setup player places their chosen number of pieces. Walls and power-ups can be placed anywhere on the inner 8x8 area (except on the four centre squares), and jokers can be placed anywhere on the outer 10x10 border. The game commences with an initial 2x2 configuration of black and white pieces in the following diagonal pattern:<br/> PLAYING PHASE<br/><br/>Two players (black and white) alternate turns placing a piece with their colour facing up onto an empty cell of the inner 8x8 board. Black always plays first. Each piece must be placed adjacent to an opponent's piece (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Then, all the opponent's pieces that are trapped in a contiguous straight line (either diagonal, vertical, or horizontal) between the newly placed piece and an existing piece of that colour, or a joker, are flipped over to the player's colour. A legal move must case at least one opponent piece to be flipped. If a player cannot make a legal move then they pass.<br/>      <br/>If a player places a piece on top of a blue bonus disc, they take the disc (this will score 3 points at the end of the game).<br/><br/>The game ends when neither player can make a legal move. Players count the pieces of their colour facing up and add the points of the blue discs. Highest score wins. Over a series of games the first aim is to win the most games. In the event of a tie in the number of games won, the point difference over the set of games decides the winner.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/>    Othello<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Wi1Qjy8EgB352ydSDBrRo7MWEVI=/fit-in/200x150/pic1441845.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/9MgHFJacH2XJCwHKnhR7Ru_L2gA=/0x0/pic1441845.jpg","id":"131567","publishers":["nestorgames"],"categories":["nestorgames"],"mechanics":["Area Enclosure","Modular Board","Tile Placement"],"designers":["Simon M.

However, each die must be selected carefully to fit the building requirements. Push your luck too far &ndash; or select carelessly &ndash; and a player may find himself demolishing his city instead of building it up. Choose each die wisely and build efficiently in order to erect magnificent skyscrapers and create the best skyline!<br/><br/>Skyline is a quick push-your-luck dice game involving set collection. Unlike other dice games that provide no relationship from turn to turn and no player interaction, this game allows players to literally build upon their decisions each turn and react to their opponents' actions.<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose to roll dice from either the Construction Yard or the Abandoned District, with the goal of erecting urban buildings. Buildings are made up of three types of dice: Ground Floor dice, Mid-Floor dice and Penthouse dice. Some buildings are safer to build but provide little reward, while other buildings have poor probabilities but can have substantial impact on the success of a player's skyline.<br/><br/>After rolling their selected dice, the player must use at least one of these dice to take one of three possible actions: Abandon, Build, or Cancel Construction. The Build action is the desired outcome, of course, but can be carried out only if the die result matches what they need to build. For instance, all Ground Floor dice can be built without restriction, but a High-Rise Mid-Floor die result can be built only on top of a High-Rise Ground Floor die. Likewise, a Mid-Rise Penthouse die can be built only on a Mid-Rise Mid-Floor die. If the rolled results do not allow them to Build, then the player must Cancel Construction on one of their existing buildings. If a player does not want to Cancel Construction, then they must Abandon by placing that die in the Abandoned District, which gives their opponents the opportunity to capitalize on this failure.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, points are rewarded for completed buildings according to their height. A Level 3 building &ndash; that is, a building comprised of three dice &ndash; is worth 9 points, while a Level 4 building is worth 16, and so on.<br/><br/>Remember, the dice control the results...but the players control the dice.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/sp8NzTdU9rhEUHR_7qvvzhp_fF4=/fit-in/200x150/pic1919942.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/WXBt8tA3KVIUxtGRwXQXd8_tYto=/0x0/pic1919942.jpg","id":"121423","publishers":["Tasty Minstrel Games"],"categories":["City Building","Dice"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Press Your Luck","Set Collection"],"designers":["David Short"],"artists":["Gavan Brown","David Short"],"family":["Games by Gamesmiths","Solitaire Games","TMG Originals"]},{"yearpublished":0,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"playingtime":15,"minplaytime":10,"maxplaytime":15,"age":16,"name":"Wiener Takes All","description":"Welcome to the sausage festival!

The rightmost card is considered to be closest to your planet, so you can take it without spending an Atom token.

Then draw a new Cosmos card and add it to the left end of the row so you have 5 cards available again.<br/>     Play a card: Play a card of your hand face up in front of you and apply its effect. Most of the time the Cosmos cards can accommodate new residents on your planet, then take the Alien tokens corresponding to the icons on the card played and place them on your game board. If you end up with more Alien tokens than your board can welcome, discard the token(s) of your choice without obtaining Atom token(s) in exchange. If you play the last card you had in hand, recover all your cards at the end of your turn.<br/>     Recover cards: Collect in your hand all the cards played face up in front of you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>On top of your mandatory action you can make another optional action to choose between:<br/><br/>     Atomize: You may decide to discard one or two of the residents of your choice from your planet, receive an Atom token for each discarded Alien token.<br/>     Make a combo: Discard the Alien tokens corresponding to the pattern on the Prestige card and take it.

Each car will be fully and easily customizable without complicated charts or difficult calculations. <br/>Each player controls one car, and that car has a point value based on its attributes. At the same time, there are cards that depict various optional equipment you can install on your car. The equipment has a point cost as well.

With your crew of skilled beavers you will be charged with the task of damming rivers that legends say can&rsquo;t be dammed. To make matters worse your enemies on the other team will be fighting for the same goal. A good balance of military strategy and well placed dams will be the key to your success.

During game play you and your team will be faced with tough choices, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to get wet just make sure you can swim. DAM IT Two Sides&hellip; As the game begins, six beaver tribes march onto the battlefield. The Red, Green, and Yellow tribes form the Honored Beaver Alliance, fighting for peace, justice, and wood. The tribes of Blue, Black, and Purple unite to form the Midnight Warriors, fighting to protect the homeland of their ancestors. One Battle&hellip; There is an uneasy calm as both teams face each other from across the river. Each tribe raises its flag as the architects discuss their building strategy. The kings stand nobly to ensure victory, and out of the silence comes the command of a warrior: &ldquo;Charge!&rdquo; One River. There can be only one victor, the team with the will to Dam It.<br/><br/>The game Dam It is a team game that can be played by 2 players, 4 players or 6 players. Games involving 4 or 6 players are always played in teams. There are 4 ways to win. <br/>(1)_eliminate the kings of opposing players <br/>(2)_capture the dens of opposing players <br/>(3)_dam the end of the main channel river and control it for 6 consecutive allied turns; and <br/>(4)_control 50 or more worker beavers.<br/><br/>Game time: approximately 1 hour<br/><br/>Note: It&rsquo;s important to spend 10-15 minutes, or so reading the rules carefully.

The combat abilities of these beavers are summarized on the reference sheet under &ldquo;Combat Statistics&rdquo;.<br/><br/>1. Worker beavers comprise the bulk of your team. These beavers are easily persuaded. These beavers can collect wood and may be led into battle. The red and blue chips are used to represent the worker beavers of each team. <br/>2. A Flag beaver is an elite beaver that has been trained to repel attacks. To represent this, he is given a +2 while defending. This is the beaver holding a flag. <br/>3. A Warrior beaver is an elite beaver that has been trained in the art of war. To represent this he is given a +2 while attacking. This is the beaver with a Mohawk or with a Viking helmet (for early editions the warrior is also represented by: muscles, snorkel, eye patch, and hair). <br/>4. An Architect beaver is an elite beaver that has studied his/her whole life to become the leader in dam construction. This beaver must be present to construct dams. If the Architect beaver is eliminated, that player can not build dams. This is the beaver holding a book. <br/>5. A King beaver is an elite beaver that is cautious and effective in his war tactics. To represent this he is given a +1 while attacking and a +1 while defending. If this beaver is eliminated from the game, then all other elite beavers from that player are also eliminated, and that player&rsquo;s turn is skipped for the rest of the game.

The players are attempting to find a good hunting area while increasing their rating on the Deer Encounter Meter, which is a measure of progress toward finding where the deer are located. Eventually, players will execute Hunt actions in the hopes of seeing deer. Once a player determines that deer are present, the deer need to be identified and brought in close enough for a shot. As the deer move closer and the encounter continues, the alertness level of the deer will generally begin to increase as they sense danger nearby. If the players aren't careful, the deer may flee and ruin their chances for a shot.<br/><br/>Players have to manage their Energy levels, items, Hunter cards and save up for bonuses while staying aware of what the other players are doing and attempt to blunt their efforts where possible.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/rLzevozpY-j2OUUU46I9Dtf8EsU=/fit-in/200x150/pic1632053.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/OJwNs05jRfXiZAsjvpscrBQjD6M=/0x0/pic1632053.png","id":"141275","publishers":["The Game Crafter, LLC"],"categories":["Adventure","Animals","Environmental","Sports"],"mechanics":["Area Movement","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Modular Board","Simulation"],"designers":["Kevin Shaud"],"artists":["Kip Ayers","Mark 3 Graphic Design"],"family":["Animals: Deer","Sports: Hunting"]},{"yearpublished":2015,"minplayers":3,"maxplayers":8,"playingtime":90,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":90,"age":7,"name":"Faraway","description":"English description:<br/><br/>Have you ever dreamed of being a child again?

Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.<br/><br/>The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.<br/><br/>Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.  However, when you finally get back to Winter Range, you score more for babies and females than you do for males -- so you may find it necessary to sacrifice a male or two to predators.  Predators are controlled by your opponents, but you get to control them on your turn.  They are not major threats, but inducement to keep moving.  Collect those food points!  You'll need them for winter.<br/>The game's map centers on the Yellowstone Park area and some of the land south of there.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/6lkiuDLFweSBuKW62zp0979xe9I=/fit-in/200x150/pic343398.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/jJydv9wnNsT-fiyInti3VbCWgaU=/0x0/pic343398.jpg","id":"1235","publishers":["The Avalon Hill Game Co"],"categories":["Animals","Farming"],"mechanics":["The Avalon Hill Game Co"],"designers":["Ellsworth Boyd","Cathy Boyd","Rick Shipley"],"family":["Animals: Bears","Animals: Coyote","Animals: Deer","Animals: Sheep"]},{"yearpublished":2014,"minplayers":1,"maxplayers":8,"playingtime":120,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":120,"age":15,"name":"Swedish Parliament 2014","description":"In Swedish Parliament 2014, you play as one of eight Swedish parties and compete to become the most influential party after the 2014 parliament elections.<br/><br/>The most influential party is the one that becomes the &quot;center of gravity&quot; in the next cabinet.

So are all of your opponents.<br/><br/>The daily life of the hermits is represented by tricks of cards, and there will typically be more than one trick in play at a time. The goal is to avoid taking tricks with personality cards in them. Tricks that don't have personalities in them don't matter one way or the other.<br/><br/>The above description is from the Decktet Book, where the game first appeared.<br/><br/>Hermit is a game akin to Hearts where players are attempting to avoid taking cards that are worth points. Rather than a single suit being avoided, Hermit requires that you do not win tricks which contain &quot;personality&quot; cards, one of the three sub-types of cards in the Decktet, which represent a person following you home and thus ruining your perfect life of solitude.<br/><br/>Regardless of the number of players, tricks are played open to the table. On a player's turn they must add a card from their hand to a trick with the requirement that the card being played shares at least one suit with the last played card on that trick. If they cannot meet that requirement they must use a card to start a new trick. If the card they play is the highest rank in the trick the entire trick moves in front of them. Thus any new tricks always start in front of the player opening them.<br/><br/>When a fourth card is added to a trick it is &quot;closed&quot; and the cards are captured by whomever the trick is in front of. If on a player's turn there are no available tricks, including the first turn of the game, each player simultaneously starts a new trick and that player then takes their turn, in effect allowing them to play two cards in a row. When the last player places their last card any unclosed tricks are discarded and each personality card taken counts its rank for scoring with Crowns being rank 10.<br/><br/>When one player reaches a predetermined score, typically 66 or 100, or a certain number of deals are completed the game is over and the player with the fewest points is the loneliest and thus the winner.<br/><br/>Special rules exist regarding Aces and Crowns as well as a Shoot the Moons/Suns variant, a &quot;House Party&quot; variant, and rules for 2-player Hermit games which incorporates a &quot;Cottage&quot; and laying off throughout the game.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/-jbIUGmQaiHVdDlRclo1QTVaP3o=/fit-in/200x150/pic2357788.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/B-SHuiV7A4dcYUxJvGZ6zYua-BM=/0x0/pic2357788.png","id":"69637","publishers":["(Self-Published)"],"categories":["(Self-Published)"],"mechanics":["Hand Management","Trick-taking"],"designers":["P.

It is a modern version of the game of Poch. Each hand has three phases: &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Poker&quot;, and &quot;Michigan Rummy&quot;. All cards are dealt out, including one extra hand which remains unseen. Players place chips in the spaces for the special combinations on the playing mat/board, the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the &quot;Kitty&quot;. The first phase pays off for holding certain cards or combinations (that match the combinations on the playing layout/board). The second phase is a hand of poker; each player selecting five cards from his hand to play. A hand of Poker betting takes place, with bets added to the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the winner wins the &quot;Poker&quot; pot. In the third phase, players play a slight variation of the game of Michigan (similar to Fan Tan), and the first to go out wins the chips in the &quot;Kitty&quot;.<br/><br/>Backgammon (Acey Ducey): a classic abstract strategy game where each player has a set of 15 &quot;men&quot; that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of his men to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's men, forcing the captured men to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 men off the board.<br/><br/>Number Chek<br/><br/>Horse Race<br/><br/>Checkers: is an abstract strategy game where players move disc-shaped pieces across an 8 by 8 cross-hatched (&quot;checker&quot;) board. Pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time. If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc. Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn. A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/YhcOIj4judVYRAUeMFOtRLsO-Yk=/fit-in/200x150/pic494263.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/ORPI3YsMXetn6yz3RQ8pvEcss1M=/0x0/pic494263.jpg","boardgamecompilation":[{"_attributes":{"objectid":"2397","inbound":"true"},"_text":"Backgammon"},{"_attributes":{"objectid":"2083","inbound":"true"},"_text":"Checkers"},{"_attributes":{"objectid":"4853","inbound":"true"},"_text":"Tripoley"}],"id":"186430","publishers":["Cadaco"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Card Game"],"mechanics":["Cadaco"]},{"yearpublished":2014,"minplayers":1,"maxplayers":8,"playingtime":30,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":30,"age":10,"name":"Room 25: Season 2","description":"The famous TV show &quot;Room 25&quot; is back for a new season with two characters joining the cast: the adventurer and the psychopath.<br/><br/>In Room 25: season 2, an extension for Room 25, all characters have their own special ability.

If you have a basket and draw a balloon of the appropriate color &mdash; red for dog, blue for cat, brown for badger &mdash; you can add the balloon to the basket; if the basket now has as many balloons as animal adventurers in the basket, place the basket to the side to score points for it at the end of the game.

After having built the landscape course, you have to push, pull, lift, slide or swing the &quot;trapper&quot; from the start to the end block. This trapper has a metal eye on top, and you move it with a wooden rod with a hook at its end. Some challenges require an intermediate string between rod and pawn, while others require both hands to simultaneously move pawn and grizzly bear, the bear being another wooden piece. A third kind of piece to be moved is provisions, which you &quot;kick&quot; with the trapper.<br/><br/>When you master the challenge, the next player decides whether to change to the next parcours or try to master the same one again. Depending on the difficulty of the challenge, your piece can move 2-4 steps toward the summit. If you lose track, fall down, or lose your provisions, you have lost this challenge and must move backward! The game includes other details &ndash; e.g., owls and squirrel tokens for managing your skills and special actions &ndash; but this is more or less the whole game.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/kEj_ukwZpxA-wABOp4R2knV_r-4=/fit-in/200x150/pic1967839.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/xw0cVaVYWBc7I_oH9cCCkhNhpN0=/0x0/pic1967839.jpg","id":"144223","publishers":["Juhu-Spiele","Noris Spiele"],"categories":["Action / Dexterity","Adventure"],"mechanics":["Cooperative Play","Modular Board"],"designers":["Gerhard Junker"],"artists":["Klemens Franz","Fabia Zobel"],"family":["Crowdfunding: Startnext"],"expansions":["Blocky Mountains: A Little Game Adventure – Save the Goose","Blocky Mountains: Add-on","Blocky Mountains: Double-Set Bonus Routes","Blocky Mountains: Dream Route Card","Blocky Mountains: Starting Player Route Card","Blocky Mountains: The Big Game Adventure Book","Blocky Mountains: The Rock Slide"]},{"yearpublished":2004,"minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"playingtime":30,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":30,"age":8,"name":"Greed Quest","description":"Greed Is Good!<br/>... and there's treasure to be won, so what are you waiting for?

The game includes 20 cases based on famous crimes and criminals of the 20th Century, including the Zodiac Killer, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime.<br/><br/>The board represents the various cities the crimes occurred in, with eighteen generic locations to find clues (Pharmacy, Hotel, Airport, Supermarket, Tavern, Harbor, FBI, etc.). Players must collect clues from different locations, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card. Movement is via die roll.<br/><br/>Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something important almost anywhere in town. The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to the Time Machine and announce the solution, is the winner.<br/><br/>There are two versions of this edition: Standard and Deluxe.

He would be a danger to any survivor if he hadn't decided to focus his murderous instinct on zombies. He finds being surrounded by potential victims that are actively hunting him terribly exciting. The human mind has nothing left to teach him. The zombie mind, however, even though it seems simpler, has an interesting potential. Well, you have been warned.<br/><br/>- Against all odds, Chuck has managed to survive the rise of the zombies. Living in his parent's basement, this 30 something man child's lack of real world experience hasn't been that much of a disadvantage, since there isn't much of a world anymore. Armed with a deep knowledge of zombie survival lore gleaned off videogames and the internet, Chuck is an unlikely, chubby ally - and possible food source if things get desperate.<br/><br/>- &quot;Gary, master of none&quot;, so people used to say. Gary didn't have a solid education and his demeanor seemed too &quot;cool&quot; to find reliable work and live in the mold of everyday people. He was almost a pariah when the apocalypse struck and shattered the &quot;everyday&quot;. Don't be fooled by his outfit: for his casual unconsern, Gary has done well on its own so far. Gary has always been a survivor, and the zombies didn't really change his habbits. If you're open-minded enough to see through Gary's disguise, he could trust you and share his precious tools of the trade.<br/><br/>- Mack's story is like most - an ordinary, happy man untill the zombies rose, forced to dig deep or die. His peacefull previous life hid his true potential - unfortunatly it took burying his wife and two daughters to bring it out. Taking a car from his lot, he began a cross country zombicide, eventually joining the motley crew of survivors. Mack's fighting spirit has made him a precious resource for any team, and his manic grin gets even wider the worse the odds are!<br/><br/>- Working with putty and tiny tools, Mike has been cooped up for years in his home studio sculpting miniatures for boardgames and the like. Obsessed with his craft, he didn't notice when his wife left and took his daughter with her, and he didn't notice the zombie apocalypse either! Well, that is, until he had to stab the mailman in the eye with a sculpting pick, and the wandered outside out of curiousity to find out what was going on. Mike now works with the other survivors, although they're a little disturbed by how much joy he seems to take in the fact that actual real zombies are &quot;finally&quot; running around.<br/><br/>- Smith mustered out of the special forces straight into private &quot;security&quot;, working all over the world for the highest bidder. Specializing in wetwork and asking no questions, Smith was in town for a contract when all hell broke loose. Fortunatly for him, and unfortunatly for the zombies, he had his arsenal stashed nearby. Though used to working alone, even Smith knows he doesn't have enough bullets to take on the zombie hordes by himself. Forced to cooperate with the other survivors, he's finding it hard on his limited social skills.<br/><br/>Each character has a unique set of gameplay attributes to give you a unique gaming experience.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/hRoAqQiQ8Ea_IEccBZdBUhWOd3w=/fit-in/200x150/pic2016891.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Y7Z9wxA2mrri4qfuaK1DB_1E6lc=/0x0/pic2016891.jpg","id":"156916","publishers":["CMON Limited","Guillotine Games"],"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Horror","Miniatures","Zombies"],"mechanics":["Action Point Allowance System","Cooperative Play","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Modular Board","Player Elimination","Variable Player Powers"],"family":["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter","Zombicide"],"expansions":["Zombicide","Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak"]},{"yearpublished":2017,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"playingtime":45,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":45,"age":13,"name":"Vignobles","description":"You have just set up as a wine merchant in the best wine-growing regions in South-West France.

It follows the story of the tribes of Jacob, having relocated to Egypt during a severe famine. Initially welcomed due to the favor earned by Jacob's son Joseph, generations later forced into slavery by a Pharaoh who no longer remembered or cared for the growing nation of outsiders. The God of Jacob (re-named Israel before his death) hears the plight of the nation, and delivers them out of the hand of Pharaoh through a series of plagues which break down the hardened will of Pharaoh as well as show His power in the eyes of the region. Led by the prophet Moses, the Israelites are granted their freedom, and immediately make their migration (Exodus) back to the land promised them by God. The journey was not a pleasant one. Being in the desert with stressed resources, it often led to complaining, and sometimes outright rebellion against Moses and God Himself despite leading and providing for them.<br/><br/>This game is for 2-4 players, and at essence is a roll-and move game suitable for children. However there are also several elements of choice involved, and anyone with an interest in the Exodus story would enjoy following the path of the Israelites and being re-acquainted with the joys and pitfalls experienced along the way. The game can accommodate non-readers and readers alike, and has been designed to be playable independent of direct parental supervision. The winner of the game manages to make the journey from Egypt to the Promised Land with the most amount of points.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Q7ptnLpvYfeZybjwDxDIB9p0SB0=/fit-in/200x150/pic3023160.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/If0tflXRfnLN4rncVq9Lq-uHpa8=/0x0/pic3023160.png","id":"199011","publishers":["Upland Road"],"categories":["Adventure","Children's Game","Educational","Religious"],"mechanics":["Point to Point Movement","Roll / Spin and Move"],"designers":["Brandon Butcher"]},{"yearpublished":2009,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"playingtime":10,"minplaytime":10,"maxplaytime":10,"age":3,"name":"Felix Farbenschaf","description":"From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Conrad, the notorious colour sheep, is back in action!

Randomly placed tiles along the way will either send you forward or backwards on the path because as the game itself states, &quot;Anything can happen on the way to McDonald's!&quot; The first player to reach the Golden Arches is the winner.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/dk38GpaLQ05W3xIsftqC5ES6qD8=/fit-in/200x150/pic232328.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/NF18HeZzVjcW3Nlm-d-ADePDJXs=/0x0/pic232328.jpg","id":"30890","publishers":["Patch Products"],"categories":["Patch Products"],"mechanics":["Patch Products"],"designers":["Peggy Brown"]},{"yearpublished":2014,"minplayers":1,"maxplayers":5,"playingtime":480,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":480,"age":8,"name":"Legends of the Ancient World: Ebon Rebirth","description":"Ebon Rebirth is a programmed adventure using Dark City Games Legends of the Ancient World rule set.

Players acquire resources (food, wood, stone, metal and gold) to train troops and construct buildings to earn benefits at different stages of the game and victory points to win the game.<br/><br/>Players can acquire resources in three ways, the main one being through your peasants, with each player starting with three. You decide which resources to produce, but some are easier to get than others, so you can play it safe or risk trying for a few more precious resources. You can also gain resources through rangers, which you must first train, which takes several units of food and wood.<br/><br/>The last way to gain resources is through the bidding phase.

This is early war tank warfare with waves of B1 bis, H-39 and FCM 36 tanks sweeping into the village of Stonne with orders to force the issue and press the enemy back over the Meuse crossings.<br/><br/>Facing the threat of a collapsing front, the crisis facing the desperate French 2nd Army would be decided at the critical point at Stonne. If they could succeed and throw the Germans back across the Meuse, the enemy attack plan may well have failed. The German objective was to hold open the crucial Meuse crossings and seize the high ground at Stonne. Into this clash was drawn the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland, with its artillery and the attached Stu.Pi.Btl. 43. This elite formation would soon face waves of French tanks, including the heavy B1 bis, in heretofore unseen numbers in this classic and historic struggle.<br/><br/>Stonne 1940 includes a historical game map of the battlefield, special rules, six new scenarios, 32 die cut vehicle counters, and a Platoon Leader 2.1 campaign game.<br/><br/>Croix de Guerre: ASL Module 10 and Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1 are necessary to play this game.<br/><br/><br/>A second edition was published in 2007.

In that time the cavalry lost its pre-eminence on the battlefield, the artillery developed the art of indirect fire thanks to the introduction of the recoil mechanism, and the machine-gun evolved into a weapon to fear.<br/><br/>The period runs from the Crimean War, up through the wars of Italian Unification, the Austro-Prussian and Franco Prussian Wars, the Russo-Turkish War and on to the early days of the First World War. The system may also be successfully used to re-fight the American Civil War and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904.<br/><br/>The system is intended for large-scale actions up to corps and army level. The basic manoeuvre units are the infantry battalion, the cav<br/>alry squadron and the artillery battery. With the possible exception of independent machine-gun companies, further subdivision of forces is not considered.<br/><br/>The system may be used for any scale of figures from 5-6 mm through 10-12 mm and 15 mm up to 25-28 mm and is not dependent upon specific numbers of figures per unit.<br/><br/>Morale and combat systems have been streamlined to cut down calculation as far as feasible. Where possible, outcomes are automatic.

One player puts all the green sides face up and the other player puts all the red sides up. The towers are then placed in the big starting circle marked with red and green. <br/>With 4 players, the blue/yellow pieces are used also. Setup is the same, but blue and yellow start at the other big circle, playing then in the other direction.<br/><br/>Playing Quick Step:<br/>Roll the Dice. Move one piece that shows your color. If you land on an empty space, turn your piece face down (now the color of your opponent is visible!). If you land on any other piece(s), don't turn your pice face down. All pieces under your piece are now blocked and cannot move until you move your piece away. If you roll a &quot;6&quot;, don't turn your piece face dawn, even if you land on an empty space.<br/>It may happen that your color is not visible when it is your turn. Then you just skip your turn. The situation on the board may change and then you can play again.<br/>To reach the end of the track, you have to roll exactly the needed number and you don't turn your piece face down then.<br/><br/>The winner is the person who moves one piece directly into the ending circle.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/b7vNx7zDFQIafo4IHnc6FS5v3do=/fit-in/200x150/pic2423430.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/xpd8kutykds9SLtjA46Ypfs7qt8=/0x0/pic2423430.jpg","id":"170494","publishers":["Klee"],"categories":["Klee"],"mechanics":["Klee"]},{"yearpublished":2016,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"playingtime":20,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":0,"age":7,"name":"Pokémon TCG: Starter Pack Expansion","description":"User summary<br/><br/>Starter Pack is a Japanese-language expansion roughly corresponding to the contemporaneous English-language expansion Generations.<br/><br/>The expansion includes 72 cards.<br/><br/>","id":"242171","publishers":["The Pokémon Company (Japan)"],"categories":["Card Game","Collectible Components","Expansion for Base-game"],"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Variable Player Powers"],"family":["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"],"expansions":["Pokémon Trading Card Game"]},{"yearpublished":1947,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"playingtime":0,"minplaytime":0,"maxplaytime":0,"age":0,"name":"Weltmeister gegen Europameister","description":"World Champion Counter Europe Champion: Each player has 1 pawn (boxer) which he moves about the board.

Unique, in that unit movement and fire/combat is regulated by the use of a grid square marked playing area.  No tape measuring or movement rulers are used.  Unit movement and other actions are limited to the cost of a unit&rsquo;s available Actions Points during each turn phase, as determined during a turn order's sequence of play.<br/><br/>The basic command level is the brigade (consisting of several infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons and/or artillery batteries).  At the end of a turn, one or more Brigade Morale roll(s) are made to determine that brigade's willingness to continue the fight (number of rolls is based on the number of units destroyed or currently in &quot;bad order&quot;).  The roll(s) determine if that Commander retreats 1 or more squares.  The command radius (in squares) is always determined from the respective brigade commander's position or unit objective square (if orders achieved). If a unit starts a turn within &quot;Command Radius,&quot; it allows the unit to be issued an order cube, otherwise it must use all of its movement for the turn to try and get back in command.  An experienced player can control a division or corps with little difficulty after only playing the game a couple of times.<br/><br/>Players provide their own miniatures and terrain, using any size scale and basing of miniatures (generally 6mm to 28mm range).  The general rule figure scale is based upon a 60:1 scale for infantry/Cavalry.  The gaming area can be marked by various methods to show grid square designated areas.  An optional grided gaming mat can be used as the terrain base.<br/><br/>The initial release of the rules covers the campaign conflict between France and Austria in 1809 (but other nation units from different theaters of operation and time frames fought can easily be adapted for play).  There's also a special section for set up of tournament style battles.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/IovoBiKXb-yvAYTF-5JSIm2iheQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic2716698.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/UT0FEfwEDG9R7ryImMA-E8Mr0Cw=/0x0/pic2716698.jpg","id":"186264","publishers":["(Self-Published)"],"categories":["Miniatures","Napoleonic","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Action / Movement Programming","Action Point Allowance System","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"designers":["Robert Buehler","Jack Decker","Kevin French"]},{"yearpublished":1991,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"playingtime":30,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":30,"age":6,"name":"Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: 3D spel","description":"Shredder has a terror plan to destroy the city's entire sewer system.

Ant was once his greatest student until Chrissy's thirst for innocent blood turned the young soldier against his team and into a life of isolation.

If you fall victim to one of the Soldiers, respawning is no longer an option. You are instantly killed and any Cure cards you were holding become compromised with the Solders' evil decoy-deception. Now your allies must roll a successful Cure Retrieval value TWICE before they can take the Cure card and win the game.<br/><br/>Despite their advantages in both stealth and strength, the Black Ops Soldiers are still only human. If you can manage to do so, killing one will reward you dearly - not in points and not in monetary value, but with the knowledge that you and your comrades can walk the desolate streets of an apocalyptic Endicott with a bit more safety. But beware - the Zombies still run amok, and they LOVE adrenaline-pumped prey!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>18 Game Cards <br/>88 5/8&quot; Chits <br/> 7 Game Mats<br/> 1 Full Color 2-sided rules sheet<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/KFEw9qEF1mOhrBW6MWs_X2ufM3E=/fit-in/200x150/pic1224776.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/9Lz1MGE1u3Ax1CbEY1-kPT0xLsk=/0x0/pic1224776.jpg","id":"89996","publishers":["T.O.G.

With this new set of wargames rules, players can take on the role of these warlords and command their own armies on the tabletop. Written by the author of the popular Glutter of Ravens rules set, Dux Bellorum is an element-based system, where each base of figures represents 50 fighting men. Each player has a specific number of points with which to construct his force and can choose to a Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, or Sea Raider army. The game is then played out following a set of simple, fast-paced rules. A completely self-contained gaming system, Dux Bellorum is perfect for gamers who are looking for a way into fighting Dark Age battles without investing a lot of time or money in larger rulesets.<br/><br/>From the playtest introduction:<br/><br/>Dux Bellorum is an Arthurian-era Dark Ages wargame, set in the period from the mid fourth century AD to the end of the eighth century AD. The rules emphasise the influence an army&rsquo;s commander has on his units, with simple manoeuvre rules and chaotic, swirling close combat. You'll win by inspiring the right troops at the right time, balancing quality versus quantity in your army, and by finding a sprinkling of luck at the right time.<br/><br/>All distances are given in Base Widths, which allows the game to be used with any scale of miniature based in many different ways. An army usually has 6-12 units, and each unit is rated for Aggression (Attacks), Protection (Defence), and Cohesion (Strength) and is trained either as Shieldwall, Warriors, Riders, or Skirmishers (all of which operate differently in the game).<br/><br/>Dux Bellorum armies are selected from following lists: Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, Land Raider, Sea Raider.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/h1--nbsAmVVGHtr0AQfBeAYTDRA=/fit-in/200x150/pic1228856.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/DY6XcPQjfQPBRnrPSeEtfeTdAL4=/0x0/pic1228856.jpg","id":"88079","publishers":["Osprey Publishing"],"categories":["Ancient","Book","Fighting","Medieval","Miniatures","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Osprey Publishing"],"designers":["Daniel Mersey"],"artists":["Angus McBride","José Daniel Cabrera Peña","Wayne Reynolds"],"family":["The Legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table","Osprey Wargames Series"]},{"yearpublished":2007,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"playingtime":0,"minplaytime":0,"maxplaytime":0,"age":0,"name":"Martian Empires","description":"Martian Empires is a set of Fast Play rules for Victorian Science Fiction Games using 15mm figures.

You play a card, you gain or lose some points, and the player with the most points when the GAME OVER card is played wins. But there's a catch or two: First, the GAME OVER card is double-sided, so everyone knows where it is at all times.  Second, over half of the cards in WTF contain blanks and you get to fill them in and finish the rules!  You might get a card that lets you determine how many points players gain or lose, or you might get a card that lets you require all players to perform some ridiculous task of your choosing.  Each card simply must follow on the &quot;suit&quot; of the previous card -- but many of the suits are made up by the players as they play! The big catch is that you actually write on the cards each game, so your deck is always changing.  The result is that the card that seemed funny when it made the player to your left eat his own earwax is a lot less funny when it comes back around to the player on your right!  For even more excitement, you can mix up your deck with another friend's deck and see what happens. It&rsquo;s up to everyone to decide how far you have to go to get points and keep the GAME OVER card out of the point leader&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/fiuyduW8WC_lGu9qeB65F-8ksmA=/fit-in/200x150/pic101331.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/uy8nW0h-EPExcW3CBwyK9RooVOg=/0x0/pic101331.jpg","id":"19143","publishers":["Metaversal Studios"],"categories":["Card Game","Collectible Components","Humor","Party Game"],"mechanics":["Partnerships","Trading","Voting"],"designers":["Jay Laird"]},{"yearpublished":2018,"minplayers":1,"maxplayers":4,"playingtime":25,"minplaytime":10,"maxplaytime":25,"age":8,"name":"Goldräuber","description":"Goldr&auml;uber is a fast, exciting, cooperative game with simple rules for 1-4 players, which are also understood by small treasure hunters from 8 years up.

Alternating is diced and considered whether to turn over a face-down card, to move the pawn to an already-revealed card, or to chop a stone wall that blocks the path.<br/><br/>As if the way into the mountain was not already arduous enough, the guardian of the treasure can break down a gallery from time to time.<br/><br/>Only with courage, with the smart planning and the necessary little bit of luck the gold rushers can succeed in returning to daylight with their loot.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/bTklRyNroTps86g9_wcJpSNcaLk=/fit-in/200x150/pic3706882.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/zxI-2M2ac8DYnUsx8FiSgKLrhoo=/0x0/pic3706882.jpg","id":"233630","publishers":["Spieltrieb"],"categories":["Adventure","Dice","Exploration","Maze"],"mechanics":["Spieltrieb"],"designers":["Daniel Bernsen"],"artists":["Christian Opperer"],"family":["Die kleinen Feinen"]},{"yearpublished":2018,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"playingtime":120,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":120,"age":10,"name":"King Cat","description":"You will gain control of 1 of 4 unique Cat Kingdoms seeking dominance of your the home.

Those vegetables are then harvested and taken to the local market where players sell to the waiting customers.<br/><br/>A game of Matakana takes place over rounds of two distinct phases: Gardening &amp; Harvesting.<br/><br/>GARDENING PHASE<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Gardening phase, players will compete with each other to take a row of cards that will allow them to cultivate their garden. The cards that players collect are:<br/><br/>1) Gnome cards - allows players to collect gnomes which act as a currency of sorts when planting seeds<br/><br/>2) Soil cards - allows players to take soil tiles and lay them in their garden (soil tiles come in various shapes and sizes and you will need them before you can plant any seeds)<br/><br/>3) Sunshine cards - dictates which columns in your garden you are able to plant seeds in this round.<br/><br/>Depending on the draw of the cards some rows will be more lucrative than others and it will be up to the players to decide when is time to compete for those cards. Once players have collected their cards they will lay soil and plant seeds according to those cards.<br/><br/>HARVESTING PHASE<br/><br/><br/><br/>The second phase of the round involves rolling 3 regular dice to determine which column of your garden will harvest vegetables.  The player rolling the dice choices a pair of dice from the roll and the sum of those dice is the column in the garden that all players can harvest.  Players then take vegetable cards that match the seeds they have planted into their hand.<br/><br/>Players will now have an opportunity to openly trade with each other for vegetables that they do not have.  Players will do this to sell a certain group of vegetables to waiting customers at the local market.  The market is a 9x9 grid made up of 9 customers of varying colours.  Each of these customers is wanting different combinations of vegetables and the players who can serve that customer with the vegetables that they are wanting will take that &quot;Customer&quot; and place it face up in front of them.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/><br/><br/><br/>Once the deck of Customers runs out the game will end and players will tally up their scores.  Points are given for:<br/><br/>1) Creating full columns of seeds in their garden<br/>2) Having the majority of Customers of a certain colour (with points available for those in 2nd and 3rd)<br/>3) Having the most money at the end of the game<br/><br/>To do well in Matakana requires a player to do well in all areas of the game: creating a bountiful garden that harvests often, trading wisely with other players to ensure you have the vegetables that you need and finally, keeping an eye on what customers other players are serving so that you can maximize your scoring opportunities.<br/><br/>A game of Matakana takes approximately 60-90 minutes and players 3-5 players.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/F1asY-BKOJXnhN01aTErJx-a-_U=/fit-in/200x150/pic1258065.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/L4fZvbvt0ueylxPHbcuDLMyWSRY=/0x0/pic1258065.jpg","id":"120887","publishers":["(Unpublished)"],"categories":["Dice","Farming","Negotiation"],"mechanics":["Auction/Bidding","Card Drafting","Dice Rolling","Set Collection","Trading"],"designers":["Chris Parker"]},{"yearpublished":0,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":0,"playingtime":180,"minplaytime":180,"maxplaytime":180,"age":8,"name":"BattleAxe","description":"BattleAxe<br/>by Nick Ryan<br/><br/>BattleAxe is an dark age battlefield warefare simulation tabletop game for 2 players (or 2 teams) that allows the players to use their strategic skills against each others armies. The main goal is to kill the opponent's King. Each army consists of 26 numbered men, 2 warhorses. Your army including axe-men, spearmen, swordsmen, archers, an engineer, horsemen and 1 king, all with different and balanced attributes. The fighting/attacking mechanism is an elegant 1 to 3 custom dice rolling system. Each player has the exact same army, similar to Chess, as to see which player really has superior strategic skills. Asymmetrical games can also be played with endless scenarios.<br/><br/>Each player has an &quot;Army Map&quot; sheet for his army which illustrates and keeps track of each warrior and warhorse. Each man in your army has his own health meter, skills, attributes, and even a place for the player to name them. This gives an unparalleled  up-close-and-personal view from the battlefield. Engineers are a big part of the game, they can cut down trees, construct archer towers to enhance their attack range, walls, fire trenches and even make extra arrows for your archers. The concept of fire, from fire arrows and fire trenches symbolized by &quot;wild fire&quot; tiles are also a big part of the game. Fire can spread and take down your walls and towers which creates a real feel of the chaos of war.<br/><br/>It's who the better strategic commander is, not who can level up faster with fairy dust and gold coins.<br/>It's dividing and concurring enraged enemy forces, not gathering grain for the winter.<br/>It's swiftly destroying the opposing King and all his men to become the one true King of the battlefield.<br/>It's BattleAxe.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/A2VrYVtbjFll7UweUO_YKwttpIQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic1780681.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/5SBxP2btSCCFZS7QE5j6zXP9j6I=/0x0/pic1780681.jpg","id":"138623","publishers":["(Self-Published)","(Unpublished)","Idyllwild Games"],"categories":["Fighting","Medieval","Miniatures","Territory Building","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Paper-and-Pencil","Press Your Luck"],"designers":["Nick Ryan"],"artists":["Nick Ryan"],"family":["Admin: Unreleased Games","Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]},{"yearpublished":1977,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"playingtime":0,"minplaytime":0,"maxplaytime":0,"age":7,"name":"Jim'll Fix It","description":"Game based on a popular television show where Jimmy Saville (an eccentric disc jockey) fulfils viewer's ambitions.

Every turn your bullets move in the direction they're fired. Zip around the map, fire your bullets and be the last animal standing.<br/><br/>User summary<br/><br/>The game is played on a large grid play surface with boundary edges.  Players alternate turns.  During a player's turn they move their token and may fire a projectile (each projectile is fired in one of eight directions).  After each player moves and fires, all projectiles move one square in the direction of their invariable travel.  Projectiles that move into an occupied square &quot;hit&quot; the object in the square and become expended.  Player tokens that are thus hit incur damage.  Note that projectiles do not &quot;belong&quot; to one player or another, and it is possible for players to &quot;shoot themselves&quot;.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to remain alive longer than your opponent.  The first player destroyed loses; the other player wins.<br/><br/>Anything that &quot;moves off&quot; the right side of the play surface reappears on the left side of the play surface; anything that &quot;moves off&quot; the top of the play surface reappears on the bottom of the play surface, etc., in a mode common to many old video arcade games.  Thus, as turns progress the grid becomes increasingly encumbered with projectiles (insuring that impacts occur increasingly frequently).<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/XpViYZ4A4K6kWx5e7JDUHVPUhfg=/fit-in/200x150/pic3948385.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/IQfZRXGCW05DJ8yEcoW0tAdBJc8=/0x0/pic3948385.jpg","id":"242527","publishers":["(Web published)"],"categories":["Fighting","Print & Play","Video Game Theme"],"mechanics":["Action / Movement Programming","Grid Movement","Player Elimination"],"designers":["Brian Wolf"],"artists":["Brian Wolf"]},{"yearpublished":2013,"minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"playingtime":45,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":45,"age":14,"name":"Politiko (2nd Ed)","description":"It&rsquo;s election time!

But you can play Stripping Viking as well as you can play it just by collecting black points which is another funny way to play.<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards are played. Then the winner or winners are determined depending on a game type. Winner is a player who has lowest score or the player who has the most pieces of clothing or the player who drank less than others. It is very simple to recognize winners and losers.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/NzE2BWvqa_EgY2IxCgfeoqa0CZE=/fit-in/200x150/pic2699329.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/AVAnOZ4LAkJLJPHjxYNotP6k9lg=/0x0/pic2699329.jpg","id":"157896","publishers":["(Self-Published)"],"categories":["Card Game","Party Game"],"mechanics":["Action / Movement Programming","Memory","Press Your Luck","Rock-Paper-Scissors"],"designers":["Tibor Kiss","Martin Senkar","Peter Suchár"],"artists":["Juraj Kopacka"],"family":["Crowdfunding: Indiegogo","Vikings"]},{"yearpublished":1990,"minplayers":3,"maxplayers":12,"playingtime":60,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":60,"age":0,"name":"Sabado Gigante","description":"Players play as individuals or teams.

Game five challenges the players to guess the prices of merchandise. The sixth space gets its entire deck.

Every player gets a Hat Card, 5 (random) Craft Cards, and 3 Bravo Chips. The Heckle Cards are placed in the middle of the playing area, and the StoryTimer is handed to the player who is going first.<br/><br/>The game starts with the first player reading aloud one of the 53 included storylines. There are three phases to play:<br/><br/>Phase I: StoryTelling<br/>The player holding the StoryTimer creates (speaking out loud) the next part of the story (typically a sentence or two). Play moves around the table, with each player creating and speaking a new addition to the story. During this time, if a StoryTeller uses one of the elements on your Craft cards, you place it next to your Hat Card. Bravo Chips can also be tossed to StoryTellers who do a particularly good job.<br/><br/>Phase II: Discussion<br/>Anyone who played a Craft Card points it out to the others. If no one object, it goes on to that player's Hat Card and will be a point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Phase III: Recitation<br/>The player holding the StoryTimer gives a Recitation of the story so far. Other players can toss Bravo Chips for a Recitation well done. The StoryTimer is passed to the left, everyone draws back up to 5 Craft Cards, and we go back to Phase I.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players vote to assign awards (most creative, most hilarious, most surprising, most dramatic). These go into the recipients' hats.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most points in his or her hat.<br/><br/>A couple notes about the cards are in order. Craft Cards contain elements of the StoryTellers Craft, which means that players score points by either using or recognizing good storytelling. There are also Heckle Cards which are common to everyone and can be tossed to stop things from getting out of hand.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.liveoakgames.com/storytellers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.liveoakgames.com/storytellers</a><br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/eRNMTPezOMHiF5es14RQY9Z7bpQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic232975.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/KUxm9SY1gA80bcgYom7bdYGmwUI=/0x0/pic232975.jpg","id":"31026","publishers":["Live Oak Games"],"categories":["Card Game","Memory","Party Game","Word Game"],"mechanics":["Cooperative Play","Memory","Storytelling","Voting"],"designers":["Patrick Matthews"]},{"yearpublished":2011,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"playingtime":40,"minplaytime":40,"maxplaytime":40,"age":7,"name":"Star Wars Board Game","description":"Publishers site:<br/>In this adventure trivia game, you are a member of the Resistance movement, which aims to destroy the evil Darth Vader and the Empire he leads.

Game mechanics have been streamlined to allow players to control more units; however, the flavor of Gaslight has been retained.  48 pages.<br/><br/>Units in Gaslight generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters, in Battles by Gaslight this is expanded so that a player will control three or four entire units each led by a (Main Character) Commander which are in turn led by an overall Army Commander. A player may also control vehicles and their crews. The games are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.<br/><br/>Command and control is accomplished now through a combination die roll and card-draw turn system. Movement is based on moving entire units as they activate, keeping them within distance of their Commander. Firing is done by units as a whole now instead of individual figures like in Gaslight (although Main Character Commanders may fire separately) and the firing procedure is still very streamlined. Morale is handled in a similar fashion to Gaslight with minor adjustments.<br/><br/>The authors made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules.  Instead the rules allow for the use of any vehicles, weapons, and creatures that players desire for their personal perception of Victorian science fiction.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/PMAWwWUWlQojFrrHkuFVs3N3edk=/fit-in/200x150/pic996131.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/il05RbAqBPAlCDoe9lEEQG2HTfg=/0x0/pic996131.png","id":"95690","publishers":["LMW Works"],"categories":["Miniatures","Science Fiction","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Variable Player Powers"],"designers":["Christopher Palmer","John R. \"Buck\" Surdu"],"family":["Steampunk"],"expansions":["Gaslight"]},{"yearpublished":2007,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"playingtime":0,"minplaytime":0,"maxplaytime":0,"age":0,"name":"Rombo","description":"From the designer's website:<br/><br/>Rombo is a boardless strategy game in which players add pieces to a steadily growing cluster in an effort to cut off enemy areas.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Two players, White and Black, each have 24 pieces of their colour called rombos.

The Ortus arena is believed to be the origin of all things, the place where the prime elements were fed with the raw energies to shape the world as we know it. How true this is can be debated, but this is the only place where energy still flows freely in its purest form. Players must harvest these energies and channel them to their warriors as fast and unpredictable Wind warriors, clever positioning of supporting Fire warriors, and devastating blows from lethal Water warriors will all be necessary to claim victory.<br/><br/>Ortus takes place on a hexagonal board, with each player starting with eight warriors (two of each element) on the back row (the &quot;Haven&quot;) in an order of their choice. Ortus is played in rounds, which each consist of four stages:<br/><br/><br/>     Collect energy: Each warrior on an energy well generates energy, which flows into the player's general pool.<br/>     Maneuver warriors: Players can spend 1 energy per hex to move warriors to better locations or attack opposing warriors.<br/>     Return the fallen: When the active player returns his fallen warriors to his Haven, his turn ends.<br/>     Defend: Energy remaining from the maneuver phase can be used to defend warriors against incoming attacks; more specifically, each attack has a certain power, and if the defender is unable or unwilling to pay energy equal to this power, the warrior falls.<br/><br/><br/>When a player occupies five energy wells at the start of his turn or has removed all eight opposing warriors, he wins.<br/><br/>Ortus has a gentle learning curve, starting with the Basic game, which can be taught in around eight minutes. From there, players can introduce the special rules for each of the elemental warriors one at a time to learn the full Advanced game. Each warrior has two unique skills that differentiate it from the others. Being able to move all of your warriors on the board gives an enormous amount of tactical options. The excitement of the game lies in the careful planning of your attacks, knowing when to advance and when to withhold Energy as well as knowing whether to save or sacrifice your warriors.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/HG3oYAZwS3whQAWPyIpUNqu0FiM=/fit-in/200x150/pic1720401.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/92S3LS_3IbBc6grksjO4FUorfwY=/0x0/pic1720401.jpg","videogamebg":{"_attributes":{"objectid":"210154"},"_text":"Ortus Arena"},"id":"103975","publishers":["FableSmith","Game Fabrica","Tailor Games"],"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Fighting"],"mechanics":["Action Point Allowance System","Area Control / Area Influence","Grid Movement"],"designers":["Joost Das"],"artists":["Marlies Barends","Joost Das"],"family":["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"],"expansions":["Ortus Tactica"]},{"yearpublished":2001,"minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"playingtime":0,"minplaytime":0,"maxplaytime":0,"age":0,"name":"Wizards","description":"&ldquo;Two-player Card game based on the animated film WIZARDS by Ralph Bakshi.

Playability is the thrust of these rules, not complexity. Included are rules for setting up a campaign series of games, but players wishing more expansive campaigns will find the basics herein to enlarge upon. To reflect the conditions of the American theater during the various times of combat, heavy cavalry has been omitted -- but militia, riflemen, and natives (Indians) are included. With additions and adjustments of a minor nature, these rules will be eminently suitable for European warfare in the same period.<br/><br/>","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Y6-0xmmnPj9-8ochNffabP3jBTg=/fit-in/200x150/pic4162425.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/uBTtEL6OtJEEimS135pB1HmJz_U=/0x0/pic4162425.jpg","id":"7793","publishers":["TSR"],"categories":["American Revolutionary War","Miniatures","Wargame"],"mechanics":["TSR"],"designers":["John F.

Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.
